## [NNStreamer](https://nnstreamer.ai) is a Linux Foundation AI & Data project.


### [NNStreamer](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer) allows gstreamer pipelines to include neural networks as filters for arbitrary ML applications.

There are a few spin-off projects:

### [NNTrainer](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nntrainer) is an on-device AI training framework for AI personalization without data privacy worries.

### [ML API](https://github.com/nnstreamer/api) is a set of API for NNStreamer and NNTrainer for Tizen and other Linux distros.

#### ML-Service-API allows to register and access modularized AI services locally and remotely.

This allows separating code repos or developer organizations of AI services and their applications.

This also allows writing among-device AI systems including Home Edge AI systems with Matter / SmartThings much easier.
